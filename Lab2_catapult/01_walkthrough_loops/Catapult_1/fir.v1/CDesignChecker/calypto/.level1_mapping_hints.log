# Flops to consider for mapping, and Xs/Zs potentially responsible,
# for every map that falsifies in level 1 (full relaxation) analysis.

# LEGEND: S - structurally reachable
#         C - cx-aware     reachable
#         M - mapped flop
#         U - unmapped flop
#         X - unmapped X/Z value
